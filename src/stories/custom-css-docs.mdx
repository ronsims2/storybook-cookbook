# Custom styles

# Fonts

TL;DR; looks at the [.storybook/preview.ts](https://github.com/ronsims2/storybook-cookbook/blob/bf37b71b6928079ab250de1a700d6754193d09f5/.storybook/preview.ts) and [.storybook/styles.scss](https://github.com/ronsims2/storybook-cookbook/blob/bf37b71b6928079ab250de1a700d6754193d09f5/.storybook/styles.scss) to see how custom styles have been applied to this page.

It can be tricky to adjust the font size for documents. While themes and decorators work well for stories, the API doesn't extend to documents (MDX).
To apply custom styles, [add a custom stylesheet](https://storybook.js.org/docs/configure/styling-and-css#import-bundled-css-recommended) to Storybook and target the selectors (class names and elements) that you find by inspecting the DOM.

```
// .storybook/preview.ts

import '../src/styles/global.css';
```

‚ö†Ô∏è This approach is considered advanced and is not officially supported (although mention in their docs as an [escape hatch](https://storybook.js.org/docs/configure/user-interface/theming#css-escape-hatches)).

You can use SASS to quickly build a style hierarchy based that targets the content in an MDX doc. Currently.
The `font-size` of this document is effectively increase by targeting elements that descend from `.sbodcs`.

üìù If you want to use SASS as a CSS solution (liek this example does), install `sass-embedded`

```
npm i sass-embedded -D
```

### Custom styles applied to lists

1. foo
2. bar
3. baz

- foo
- bar
- baz

### Custom styles applied to special lists

- [x] foo
- [ ] bar
- [ ] baz

### Custom styles applied to tables

| Foo | Bar | Baz  |
| --- | --- | ---- |
| 42  | 99  | 105  |
| 3   | 6   | 9    |
| 50  | 11  | 1000 |
